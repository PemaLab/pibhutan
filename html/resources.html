        <h1>Current Reality</h1>
        <p>
          The forceful expulsion of exiled Bhutanese, also known as Lhotshampas,
          from their homes in the early 1990s is considered a major human rights
          violation. The Bhutanese government, which is dominated by the Drukpa
          ethnic group, targeted the Lhotshampas, who are primarily of Nepali
          origin, claiming that they posed a threat to Bhutanese culture and
          national identity. As a result, the government began a campaign of
          intimidation and violence, forcing tens of thousands of Lhotshampas to
          flee to neighboring Nepal. Many of these exiles were subjected to
          harsh conditions in refugee camps and faced discrimination and
          restrictions on their rights, including restrictions on their ability
          to work, access healthcare and education, and participate in political
          activities.
        </p>
        <p>
          Additionally, many exiled Bhutanese who were captured and imprisoned
          by the Bhutanese government faced torture and other forms of
          mistreatment, resulting in numerous deaths. Furthermore, many
          Lhotshampas are still missing and their whereabouts are unknown,
          leaving their families and loved ones in a state of uncertainty and
          distress. The ongoing human rights violations against the exiled
          Bhutanese have led to calls for justice and accountability, as well as
          efforts to secure their rights to return to their homes and land in
          Bhutan. The situation of the exiled Bhutanese serves as a reminder of
          the importance of protecting the rights of all individuals, regardless
          of their ethnicity or nationality, and the need for governments to
          uphold their obligations under international human rights law.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thousands of Bhutanese families have been separated since their
          forceful expulsion. More than 110,000 Bhutanese refugees have been
          resettled in western countries, but they are not able to reunify or
          meet with their loved ones. Their parents are dying without meeting
          their children and vice versa or are unable to be present in their
          last rituals. Unfortunately, the government of Bhutan does not allow
          resettled Bhutanese to visit their native country, further adding to
          the pain of separation.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is important to recognize that family unification plays a critical
          role in the happiness and well-being of the Bhutanese people. The
          separation of families caused by the Bhutanese refugee crisis has
          resulted in immense emotional distress and suffering, leaving many
          individuals and communities without the support and care of their
          loved ones. Therefore, prioritizing family reunification and finding
          ways to facilitate this process should be a key focus of any efforts
          to address the crisis. By working towards reuniting families and
          providing support for their integration and well-being, it may be
          possible to improve the mental health and overall happiness of the
          Bhutanese people. Ultimately, a society that values and prioritizes
          family unity and well-being can lead to a more prosperous and
          harmonious community for all.
