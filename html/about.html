            <h1>About Us</h1>
            <p>
              In the late 1980s and early 1990s, Bhutanese citizens of Nepali
              origin were subjected to a campaign of forced exile by the
              Bhutanese government. This was part of a larger process of
              cultural homogenization in the country, in which the Bhutanese
              government sought to preserve the dominant culture of the Ngalop
              people, who had absolute power in their hands.
            </p>
            <p>
              The ethnic Nepalese, also known as Lhotshampas, are primarily of
              Nepali origin and make up a significant minority in Bhutan. They
              have a distinct culture and language and had lived in Bhutan for
              generations. However, in the 1980s and early 1990s, the Bhutanese
              government introduced a series of laws and policies aimed at
              promoting the dominant Ngalop culture, which ethnic Nepalese
              perceived as discriminatory.
            </p>
            <p>
              As a result, many ethnic Nepalese became politically active and
              began to demand greater representation and rights. This led to a
              crackdown by the Bhutanese government, which responded with
              violence and forced exile. Over the next few years, tens of
              thousands of ethnic Nepalese were forcibly evicted from Bhutan and
              forced to flee to refugee camps in Nepal.

          The situation of the Bhutanese refugees has been a source of ongoing
          concern and controversy, with many of them remaining in exile for over
          two decades. Efforts have been made to find a durable solution to the
          refugee crisis, but a lasting resolution has yet to be achieved.
          Currently, close to seven thousand Bhutanese refugees live in two
          refugee camps in Nepal without any foreign assistance. And a majority
          of them have been relocated to eight different western countries,
          including Canada, the United States, Denmark, the United Kingdom, the
          Netherlands, Australia, and Norway.

            <h1>About PIB</h1>
            <p>
              The Peace Initiative Bhutan (PIB) is a non-profit organization
              based in the United States of America. Its primary goal is to
              promote positive peace and reconciliation in Bhutan through mutual
              trust and understanding. PIB does not have an adversarial approach
              toward the Government of Bhutan; instead, it seeks to find a
              mutually beneficial solution through sincere dialogue,
              compassionate listening, and active participation in a
              comprehensive peacebuilding process. It plays a positive role in
              bridging the existing gap between the Government of Bhutan and the
              Bhutanese in the diaspora.
